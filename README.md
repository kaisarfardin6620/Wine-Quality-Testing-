# Wine-Quality-Testing-
The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to predict the quality of red wine based on various chemical properties, such as acidity, alcohol content, sugar levels, and more. The dataset, which contains data for red wines, was analyzed using several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearch to optimize the models' performance. The models were evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess how well the predictions match the actual wine quality scores. This project provides a comprehensive approach to using machine learning techniques for predicting wine quality.
